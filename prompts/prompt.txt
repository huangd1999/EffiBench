Please based on the task description write Solution to pass the provided test cases. 
You must follow the following rules:
First, the code should be in ```python\n[Code]\n``` block.
Second, You should not add the provided test cases into your ```\npython[Code]\n``` block.
Third, You are not need to write the test cases, we will provide the test cases for you.
Finally, You should make sure that the provided test cases can pass your solution.

Here is a example:
Example:
# Task description
```python
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

# Test cases
```python
solution = Solution()
assert solution.twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) == [[0, 1]]
```

# Code
```python
from typing import *
import random

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        hashtable = dict()
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if target - num in hashtable:
                return [hashtable[target - num], i]
            hashtable[nums[i]] = i
        return []
```
